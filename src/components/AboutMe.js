        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Alora, a former educator transitioning into software engineering. With six years of experience teaching 4th grade and middle school math, I’ve always been driven by a passion for helping others succeed and solving problems. My work in the classroom involved adapting curriculum to diverse learning needs, creating efficient systems to streamline tasks, and building strong relationships with students, parents, and colleagues.
        I come from a large family—I'm the seventh of nine—and as the first to graduate high school, I know firsthand how important access to opportunities is. This mindset has shaped my career, both in education and in my transition to software engineering. I see programming as a powerful tool for building solutions that improve lives and increase efficiency, particularly in areas like EdTech, food access, and environmental sustainability.
        Outside of work, I love to travel, play ultimate frisbee, and spend time outdoors, always looking for ways to connect with new places and people. As I continue my journey in tech, I’m excited to apply my problem-solving skills and lifelong learning mindset to create impactful tools and systems.
